Super-seeded by github.com/balupton/history.js - jQuery History allows you to easily track changes of the pages state by tracking URL Hashes. Supports changes triggered by bookmarks and back & forward buttons, as well as cross browser support.


### Usage

Refer to the [demo](http://balupton.github.com/jquery-history/demo/) and the [source code](https://github.com/balupton/jquery-history/tree/master/scripts/resources)


### Query Strings

If you would like to have a QueryString in your hash and fetch the contents of it. So for example we have:

	http://localhost/page/#subpage?a=true&b=false

And we would like to extract b. Then we can do:

	var hashData = hash.queryStringToJSON();
	console.log(hashData); // {a:true,b:false}
	console.log(hashData.a); // true
	console.log(hashData.b); // false

But first, you will have to download the queryStringToJSON function from within here:

	https://github.com/balupton/jquery-sparkle/blob/master/scripts/resources/core.string.js

And place it within your own code. It is not included within jQuery History by default, as it is not essential.


## History

You can discover the history inside the [History.md](https://github.com/balupton/jquery-history/blob/master/History.md#files) file
